Each \ref Individual offers an amount of forage (kgDM/mÂ²) that is available
to herbivores (\ref Individual.get_forage_mass()).

\todo Growth happens only once per year (\ref growth()) for natural vegetation.
However, seasonal shifts of forage availability are crucial for herbivore
dynamics.
A solution for that is yet to be found.
