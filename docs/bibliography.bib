  abstract = {Among wild ruminants, muskoxen have an exceptional ability to fatten, but their pregnancy rates are variable and often low. To test whether the likelihood of pregnancy in muskoxen is associated with exceptionally good body condition, we used logistic regression analysis with data from 32 pregnant and 18 nonpregnant muskoxen ≥ 1.5 yr of age shot in November (1989 to 1992) on Victoria Island in Arctic Canada. We assayed their serum for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). All fatness and mass measures were positively related to the likelihood of pregnancy (P < 0.001), with the strongest associations for estimated total fat mass (80 % of outcomes predicted correctly) and kidney fat mass (77 %), and weaker models for body mass. Pregnancy was less likely to occur in lactating females than in nonlactating ones (P = 0.03). Although IGF-1 concentrations were higher (P = 0.001) in nonlactating females than in lactating ones (28.7 ± 1.7 vs. 22.5 ng/ml), no association with pregnancy was detected (P = 0.57). Fatness associated with a 50 % probability of pregnancy in muskoxen (22 % of ingesta-free body mass or 32 kg fat in females > 3.5 yr old) is much higher than in caribou and somewhat higher than in cattle, and this may partly account for the low calving rates often observed in this species.}

  abstract = {Energy expenditure in animals scales allometrically with body mass, but residual variation is not well understood. We examine the existing data on field metabolic rates (FMR) in endotherms for the potential role of environmental conditions. Across latitude, mass‐corrected FMR of 248 bird and mammal populations fall between two constraint lines: a lower bound that increases towards the poles and is driven by environmental factors and an upper bound that is invariant with latitude and may represent physiological limitations. This triangular pattern can be explained statistically with a multipredictor model that combines environmental conditions and species biology (including phylogeny). Lower environmental temperature and longer day length increase FMR, while taxonomy and diet explain much of the remaining variation. Combined, these effects appear to form a diversity of ‘metabolic niches’ that overall decreases from the tropics to the poles. The potential of factors related to latitude acting as constraints on the ecology and evolution of metabolic strategies in endotherms is discussed.}

  abstract = {Published relationships were used to build a mathematical model that predicts the daily net energy balance of free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries L.) grazing in the U.K. hills. Net energy balance was predicted for a plausible range of environmental conditions. The behaviour of the model suggested the following predictions. Locomotion will be a relatively unimportant energetic cost. Ambient temperature and rainfall alone will rarely affect energy expenditure, whereas wind will greatly increase energetic costs in winter. These are further increased, but to a relatively small extent, by any concurrent rainfall. Predictions of foraging behaviour based on maximisation of energy intake alone are likely to significantly overestimate dry matter intake from climatically exposed vegetation in winter. Where shelter is available, such models will also overestimate total intake in winter by not taking account of sheltering behaviour. This effect will be most pronounced when forage is of low digestibility or availability, wind speeds are high, or the level of coat insulation is low. Foraging models based instead on maximisation of net energy balance are likely to greatly improve predictions of the impact of large herbivores on vegetation and the mechanisms driving their population dynamics.}

The evidence supporting this hypothesis is correlative, and most of it stems from observations made in humans. On balance, the evidence from human studies does not support the hypothesis, however, and the results of animal studies argue strongly against it. In the latter regard, a variety of experimental approaches have been tried in both adult and peripubertal females of several species, and the results almost uniformly show little relationship between fatness and ovulation. There is no doubt that ovulation can be regulated somehow in relation to whole-body energy balance and that fat stores are an important component of energy balance, but there is no reason to accord body fat a direct causal role in regulating ovulation.},

  abstract = { The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover. }

We test these assumptions with the most comprehensive literature data collations (n = 74 species for gut capacity, n = 93 species for DMI and MRT) to date. For MRT, only data from studies was used during which DMI was also recorded. Gut capacity scaled to BM1.06. In spite of large differences in feeding regimes, absolute DMI (kg/d) scaled to BM0.76 across all species tested. Regardless of this allometry inherent in the dataset, there was only a very low allometric scaling of MRT with BM0.14 across all species. If species were divided according to the morphophysiological design of their digestive tract, there was non-significant scaling of MRT with BM0.04 in colon fermenters, BM0.08 in non-ruminant foregut fermenters, BM0.06 in browsing and BM0.04 in grazing ruminants. In contrast, MRT significantly scaled to BM0.24 (CI 0.16–0.33) in the caecum fermenters. The results suggest that below a certain body size, long MRTs cannot be achieved even though coprophagy is performed; this supports the assumption of a potential body size limitation for herbivory on the lower end of the body size range. However, above a 500 g-threshold, there is no indication of a substantial general increase of MRT with BM. We therefore consider ingesta retention in mammalian herbivores an example of a biological, time-dependent variable that can, on an interspecific level, be dissociated from a supposed obligatory allometric scaling by the morphophysiological design of the digestive tract. We propose that very large body size does not automatically imply a digestive advantage, because long MRTs do not seem to be a characteristic of very large species only. A comparison of the relative DMI (g/kg0.75) with MRT indicates that, on an interspecific level, higher intakes are correlated to shorter MRTs in caecum, colon and non-ruminant foregut fermenters; in contrast, no significant correlation between relative DMI and MRT is evident in ruminants.}

  abstract = {Recent declines in numbers and juvenile recruitment in many elk (Cervus elaphus) herds in the western U.S. has sparked interest in factors that may cause these declines. Inadequate nutrition or delayed parturition, the latter of which may be caused by inadequate numbers of mature bulls (i.e., highly skewed sex ratios), may have separate or synergistic effects on population dynamics and productivity. We evaluated the implications of late parturition and summer-autumn nutrition on reproduction and survival of Rocky Mountain elk (C. e. nelsoni) using a captive herd of 57 cow elk. We induced early (Sep) and late breeding (Oct) and 3 levels of summer-autumn nutrition on the cows. Food was offered ad libitum at 3 levels of digestible energy (DE): high = 2.9-3.0 kcal of DE/g of diets, medium = 2.6-3.0 kcal/g, and low = 2.3-3.0 kcal/g. Within these ranges, DE content was gradually reduced from late June through early November to mimic seasonal changes in the wild. During summer and autumn, we measured calf growth; body mass, nutritional condition, and breeding dynamics of cows; and growth and pregnancy of yearlings. We also measured carry-over (i.e., time-lag) responses including over-winter calf and cow survival and parturition date and birth mass, as functions of previous summer-autumn nutrition and previous parturition date. Between autumn 1995 and spring 1998, we conducted 2 years of parturition-date, summer-autumn nutrition experiments, 2 winters of calf survival experiments, and 1 winter of cow survival experiments. Early birth provided calves with more time to grow before onset of winter. This “head-start” advantage was maintained through late autumn, but its magnitude was diluted in some instances due to faster growth of some late-born calves. Body mass, body fat, and timing and probability of conception by cows in autumn were little influenced by parturition date the previous spring. Summer-autumn nutrition significantly affected calves and their mothers. Growth of calves in the low and medium nutrition groups ceased by mid-September and late October. By December, calves in the high nutrition group were 40\% and 70\% heavier than calves in the medium and low groups, respectively. Cows in the high nutrition group accumulated about 75\% and 300\% more fat than cows in the medium and low groups by mid-October. Eighty percent of cows in the low nutrition group failed to conceive, and those in the medium group bred 10–14 days later than cows in the high group. Summer-autumn nutrition of calves influenced their probability of becoming pregnant as yearlings. Probability of pregnancy approached 100\% for those yearlings that had high summerautumn nutrition as calves and yearlings, despite near starvation their first winter of life. Winter survival of calves was related to their size at the onset of winter. Smaller calves lost more body mass daily than did large calves, and thus they survived fewer days through winter. Summer-autumn nutrition largely determined calf body size at the start of winter and, consequently, determined the proportion of winter survived. Survival of cows over winter was as related to body fat at the onset of winter as it was to nutrition during winter. Carry-over effects of summer-autumn nutrition and parturition date on birth characteristics the following spring were minor. We detected no significant carry-over effect of summer-autumn nutrition or autumn condition on birth mass, although reduced condition in autumn delayed subsequent parturition date. Extent of body fat depletion in cows during the winter-survival experiments in 1998 accounted for 45\% of the variation in parturition date. Ninety percent depletion delayed parturition an average of 34 days. Delayed parturition, of a magnitude expected due to highly skewed sex ratios (3 weeks under extreme conditions), probably has only a weak influence on vital rates of free-ranging elk. In contrast, fat accretion and probability of pregnancy of cows, and growth and overwinter survival of calves, were sensitive to small (10–20\%) differences in DE content of food. Digestible energy levels of our 2 lower nutrition levels reflect DE ranges reported for large ungulate herds during summer and autumn in western North America. Thus, our data suggest that limiting effects of summer-autumn nutrition on populations may be greater than often assumed, perhaps greater than those during winter in some ecosystems, and consequently indicate a need for greater understanding of nutrition's influence on population dynamics and how this influence varies across space and time. To enhance future research, we present animal- and vegetation-based guidelines for evaluating nutritional influences on elk populations.},

A light wetting water spray simulated heavy fog, mist or light rain, while heavy soaking simulated heavy rain. Wind velocities ranged from 0 to 10 m.s-1. Calf fur samples were from June, August and March. Adult fur samples were females from August and March. There was no evidence for increased heat loss from lightly wet fur relative to dry fur. Calm air conductance decreased for calf fur (P&rsquo;s &lt; 0.05). Adult fur also decreased, however, the difference was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). Further, wind coefficients and regressions for lightly wet fur were similar or below those for dry fur. A thin water film forming on the fur surface may have caused this. It is unlikely that a light rain, fog or mist would cause increased heat loss for Svalbard reindeer, and no increase of metabolic heat production would be needed to maintain thermoregulation. Only the simulated heavy rain dramatically raised heat loss from the fur samples examined regardless of age or season, e.g., heavy soaking increased calm air conductance for all furs (P&rsquo;s &lt; 0.05). This was likely due to the addition of evaporative heat loss from the fur surface and a reduction in the amount of trapped air within the fur. Windchill was of minor importance, since wind coefficients were generally close to zero, meaning increasing wind velocity only marginally raised heat loss even with the added effect of evaporative heat loss. Rain would cause greater insulation loss than increasing wind velocity in Svalbard reindeer of all ages, with the exception of calves under one month old, which could experience dramatic insulation loss from a combination of heavy rain and windchill. Dry or wet, Svalbard reindeer fur appears to provide better insulation than fur of others of their species.},

  abstract = {Development of nutritional energetics can be traced to the 1400s. Lavoisier established relationships among O2 use, CO2 production and heat production in the late 1700s, and the laws of thermodynamics and law of Hess were discovered during the 1840s. Those discoveries established the fundamental bases for nutritional energetics and enabled the fundamental entity ME = retained energy + heat energy to be established. Objectives became: 1) to establish relationships between gas exchange and heat energy, 2) to devise bases for evaluation of foods that could be related to energy expenditures, and 3) to establish causes of energy expenditures. From these endeavors, the basic concepts of energy partitioning by animals were developed, ultimately resulting in the development of feeding systems based on NE concepts. The California Net Energy System, developed for finishing beef cattle, was the first to be based on retained energy as determined by comparative slaughter and the first to use 2 NE values (NEm and NEg) to describe feed and animal requirements. The system has been broadened conceptually to encompass life cycle energy requirements of beef cattle and modified by the inclusion of numerous adjustments to address factors known to affect energy requirements and value of feed to meet those needs. The current NE system remains useful but is empirical and static in nature and thus fails to capture the dynamics of energy utilization by diverse animals as they respond to changing environmental conditions. Consequently, efforts were initiated to develop dynamic simulation models that captured the underlying biology and thus were sensitive to variable genetic and environmental conditions. Development of a series of models has been described to show examples of the conceptual evolution of dynamic, mechanistic models and their applications. Generally with each new system, advances in prediction accuracy came about by adding new terms to conceptually validated models. However, complexity of input requirements often limits general use of these larger models. Expert systems may be utilized to provide many of the additional inputs needed for application of the more complex models. Additional information available from these systems is expected to result in an everincreasing range of application. These systems are expected to have increased generality and the capability to be integrated with other models to allow economic evaluation. This will eventually allow users to compute solutions that allow development of optimal production strategies.},

  abstract  = { There has been a significant decline in the reproductive performance of dairy cattle in recent decades. Cows, take longer time to return to the oestrus after calving, have poorer conception rates, and show fewer signs of oestrus. Achieving good reproductive performance is an increasing challenge for the dairy producer. In this study we focus on understanding the overall biological phenomena associated with nutritional sub-fertility rather than the underlying multiplicity of physiological interactions (already described in a number of recent studies). These phenomena are important because they represent the natural adaptations of the animal for dealing with variations in the nutritional environment. They can also be used to monitor and modulate reproductive performance on-farm. There is an underlying trade-off between two aspects of reproduction: investment in the viability of the current calf and investment in future offspring. As the investment in, and viability of, the current calf is related to maternal milk production, we can expect that level of milk production per se has effects on subsequent reproductive performance (investment in future offspring). Lactating cows have a lower proportion of viable embryos, which are of poorer quality, than do non-lactating cows. The same applies to high- compared to medium-genetic merit cows. Another important biological property is the adaptive use of body reserves in support of reproduction. Orchestrated endocrine changes in pregnancy and lactation facilitate the deposition of body lipid during pregnancy and mobilisation in early lactation. When the cow fails to accumulate the reserves she needs to safeguard reproduction she delays committing to further reproductive investment. But how does the cow ‘know’ that she is failing in energy terms? We argue that the cow does this by ‘monitoring’ both the body fat mobilisation and body fatness. Excessive body fat mobilisation indicates that current conditions are worse than expected. Body fatness indicates the future ability of the cow to safeguard her reproductive investment is compromised. Both delay further reproductive commitment. The relationship between reproductive performance and; milk production as an index of maternal investment, body fatness as an index of ability to safeguard reproductive investment, and body fat mobilisation as an index of the current nutritional environment – are examined. Nutritional strategies that seek to modulate body mobilisation and the endocrine environment by use of glucogenic and lipogenic diets, and the use of in-line progesterone profiles to monitor reproductive status are then discussed in this biological context. }

We applied the Scholander{\textendash}Irving model of thermoregulation to data on hundreds of species of birds and mammals to assess the contributions of three avenues of adaptation to environmental temperature: body size, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and thermal conductance. Adaptation via body size is limited; the entire ranges of body sizes of birds and mammals occur in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we demonstrate that birds and mammals have adapted to geographic variation in environmental temperature regimes by concerted changes in both BMR and thermal conductance.The extent to which different kinds of organisms have adapted to environmental temperature regimes is central to understanding how they respond to climate change. The Scholander{\textendash}Irving (S-I) model of heat transfer lays the foundation for explaining how endothermic birds and mammals maintain their high, relatively constant body temperatures in the face of wide variation in environmental temperature. The S-I model shows how body temperature is regulated by balancing the rates of heat production and heat loss. Both rates scale with body size, suggesting that larger animals should be better adapted to cold environments than smaller animals, and vice versa. However, the global distributions of \~{}9,000 species of terrestrial birds and mammals show that the entire range of body sizes occurs in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental temperature data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we test for mass-independent adaptive changes in two key parameters of the S-I model: basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance. We derive an axis of thermal adaptation that is independent of body size, extends the S-I model, and highlights interactions among physiological and morphological traits that allow endotherms to persist in a wide range of temperatures. Our macrophysiological and macroecological analyses support our predictions that shifts in BMR and thermal conductance confer important adaptations to environmental temperature in both birds and mammals.},

We found pronounced senescence in survival rates, but no evidence for reproductive senescence. Prime-age females (<10 years old) experienced very high annual survival rates (mean = 0.97, SE = 0.02), with lower survival rates for senescent animals (10 years old; mean = 0.79, SE = 0.06). There was evidence that the severity of snowpack conditions had little effect on survival of prime-age animals except during the most extreme winter, while survival of senescent animals was progressively depressed as the severity of snowpack conditions increased. Reproductive rates remained essentially constant, near their biological maxima (mean = 0.91, SE = 0.02). Annual re cruitment was highly variable. Snowpack had a pronounced effect on recruitment (r2 = 0.91), the most severe snowpack conditions resulting in the virtual elimination of a juvenile cohort. Population estimates and recruitment rates obtained during this investigation and historic data collected from 1965 to 1980 support the premise that the population has been maintained in a dynamic equilibrium for at least three decades despite the stochastic effects of climate variation on vital rates. We conclude that the population is resource-limited, with variation about the equilibrium caused primarily by variable recruitment driven by stochastic annual snowpack.}

Checks, however, do occur and it has been the subject of much controversy to determine how these checks operate. Certain general principles—the density-dependence concept of Smith ( 1955) , the competition theory of Nicholson (1933)—have been proposed both verbally and mathematically, but because they have been based in part upon untested and restrictive assumptions they have been severelv criticized (e.g. Andrewartha and Birch 1954).

Although triacylglycerols are the prevailing structure of the food lipids in most cases, there are exceptions, too. Analytes called ether extract, crude fat, total fat and total lipids have been interpreted to food fat in nutritional labelling and food databases. However, the techniques traditionally used for fat determination in foods may vary considerably in their ability to recover the various lipid components. Diversity in the lipid composition of various foods and the effects of processing and storage on the diversity and availability of the fat make the correct nutritional labelling of fat problematic. The traditional methods, where the total fat content is determined by extracting the fat with an appropriate fat solvent or a solvent mixture, give good technical measures. The use of this extracted fat-soluble material as the nutritional concept of fat may be misleading. We have suggested (Hyvönen et al., 1993, J. Food Comp. Anal., 6, 24–40) the use of the concept of net fat in nutritional food labelling. This definition of fat includes all the unchanged fatty acids from the various food lipids converted to triacylglycerols. In energy calculations 1 g of net fat corresponds to 9 kcal or 38 kJ. This concept reduces the energy values of foods because it eliminates the lipid components, which are not real fats, from the calculation.}

  abstract = {Summary A simulation model is used to quantify relationships between diet quality, digestive processes and body weight in ungulate herbivores. Retention time of food in the digestive tract is shown by regression to scale with W0.27, and to be longer in ruminants than in hindgut fermenters. Allometric relationships between whole gut mean retention time ({MRT}, h) and weight (W) were: {MRT} = 9.4 W0.255 (r 2 = 0.80) for hindgut fermenters and {MRT} = 15.3 W0.251 (r 2 = 0.76) in ruminants. Longer retention of ingesta by large-bodied ruminants and hindgut fermenters increases digestive efficiency relative to small animals and permits them to survive on lower-quality foods. Compared with ruminants, hindgut fermenters' faster throughput is an advantage which outweighs their lower digestive efficiency, particularly on poor quality foods, provided that food resources are not limiting. This suggests that the predominance of ruminants in the middle range of body weights results from their more efficient use of scarce resources under conditions of resource depletion. Considering only physical limitations on intake, the model shows that the allometric coefficient which scales energy intake to body mass is 0.88 in ruminants and 0.82 in hindgut fermenters. The advantages of large body size are countered by disadvantages where food quantity is limited, and we suggest that the upper limit to ungulate body size is determined by the ability to extract nutrients from feeding niches during the nadir of the seasonal cycle of resource quality and abundance.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that climatic variation has the effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid grazing systems of reducing animal numbers below the level at which they have much impact on vegetation or soils, and that spatial heterogeneity in resource availability serves to buffer herbivores against climatic variation. Modelling was used to test these hypotheses and to examine the interacting effects of temporal and spatial variability in plant production on animal population dynamics and defoliation intensity. The model distinguishes areas of the range that are accessible during wet and dry seasons, and examines the effect of seasonal restrictions in foraging area. It was established that the animal population is in long-term equilibrium with dry-season resources, on which it depends for survival; that dry season resource areas and outlying areas thus operate in a source-sink manner; and that the ratio of these areas determines the strength of consumer-resource coupling outside the dry-season range. A high ratio of dry season to wet season resources may support a sufficiently large animal population to impose non-trivial defoliation impacts on the outlying range. Increasing degrees of variability in primary production on areas used by animals for surviving the dry season increased the annual variation in animal abundance and reduced the mean. By comparison with a stable environment, for which the model predicts virtually stable animal numbers and constant, low defoliation intensity, variation in annual rainfall causes wide fluctuations in animal numbers and defoliation intensity. Under climatic variation, animal numbers can build up enough to impose much higher defoliation intensities than under a constant regime. Periodic intense defoliation is a consequence of climatic variability which is likely to make these environments more, not less, prone to ecological change.},

A GMM (Growth, Metabolism and Mortality) formulation was applied to the interactive dynamics of herbivore–vegetation systems, taking into account seasonality in resource production, heterogeneity in resource quality, adaptive responses by consumers to this variability, and nutritional influences on mortality losses. In transforming the intake or functional response to changing resource availability to a biomass gain response, allowance was made for constraints on daily digestive capacity, and for changing diet quality as resources became depleted over the seasonal cycle. Because of the steeply saturating form of the intake response, the output dynamics was inherently unstable in a constant environment with a single, uniform resource, for realistic parameter values. Stabilization resulted when resources were heterogeneous and herbivores adjusted their resource selection adaptively over the course of the year. This mechanism caused the gain response to diverge from the intake response, due to changing diet quality over the annual cycle. In seasonally varying environments, no equilibrium between resource production and consumption persists. Nevertheless, dynamic stability can emerge from the adaptive responses of consumers to spatial and temporal variability in resource availability and quality.}

  abstract = { Large grazers have played a fundamental role in grassland and savannah ecosystems since these vegetation types formed in the late Miocene, but the feedback loops between vegetation and large grazers are still not well understood. Modern dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lack the explicit impact of herbivory, but are calibrated to benchmarks including herbivory. We coupled a generalized model for the population dynamics of large mammalian grazers, based on animal physiology, with a plant-physiological model for vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes, applicable at local to global scales (LPJ-GUESS). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine process-based grazer population and vegetation modelling in a single generalized modelling framework, applicable at regional to continental scales. The capability of the coupled model to reproduce real-world grazer densities was tested by comparing modelled biomass densities with empirical data from African game parks, where semi-natural grazer populations still exist. The model reproduced inter-park differences in long-term average grazer biomass densities and yielded similar dependencies between major environmental drivers (e.g. precipitation, annual net primary productivity (NPP), dry season length) and grazer population densities as found in other more empirical studies. Amongst the potential environmental drivers, modelled NPP and dry season length were most strongly correlated with empirical and modelled biomass densities. Major discrepancies between modelled and empirical densities occurred for individual parks, but this was expected because the model did not include all factors that influence grazer populations (e.g. nutrient dynamics and poaching). The generalized flexible framework of the coupled model makes it possible to apply the model to other regions, to include further processes (if data for parameterizing them is available) and to parameterize other types of grazers. It could become a useful tool for investigating interactions between grazers and vegetation in a process-based framework.}

Body masses showed a cyclical pattern, declined 14 – 31% between October and March, and were best described by a five-parameter, biologically based regression model. The amount of mass lost by black-tailed deer over winter depended on the peak body mass attained during fall. During winter, animals used 70 – 82% of their body fat and 10 – 15% of their protein reserves. Body fat was preferentially mobilized at rates 2.3 – 11.6 times higher than protein. Because of the higher energy content of fat, fat accounted for 83 – 92% of the catabolized energy. Water transfer rates varied seasonally with average summer values approximately four times those of winter; lactating deer had significantly higher rates of water transfer than nonlactating animals. Seasonal changes in all of the above parameters for wild deer were greater than those for eight deer of the same age in captivity. }

We calculated the energy-intake component from seasonal dry matter and energy content, dry matter digestibility, and a metabolizable energy coefficient for each plant species ingested. We estimated energy expenditures when foraging as the sum of energy costs of standing, horizontal and vertical locomotion, sinking depths in snow, and supplementary expenditures associated with temperatures outside thermoneutrality. Energy intake per minute averaged 4.0 times more in summer than winter; energy expenditure was 1.2 times greater in summer. Animals obtained higher amounts of metabolizable energy with higher amounts of energy invested. Energy intake during foraging bouts in summer was 2.5 times the energy invested; in contrast, energy intake during winter was only 0.7 times the energy expended. Changes in body mass of deer throughout the year increased asymptotically with foraging efficiency, driven primarily by the rate of metabolizable energy intake. Within a season, summer intake rates and winter rates of energy expediture had the greatest effects on the relation between foraging efficiency and mass status. Seasonal changes in foraging efficiency result in seasonal cycles in body mass and condition in black-tailed deer. Body reserves accumulated during summer, however, are essential for over-winter survival of north-temperate ungulates because energy demands cannot be met by foraging alone. }

  abstract  = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.}

The book discusses the five major nutritional categories of constituents that animals must acquire from their external environments: energy, protein, water, minerals, and vitamins. Subsequent chapters cover topics such as the estimation of energy and protein requirements; dietary protein requirements for captive wildlife and free-ranging populations; wildlife reproductive characteristics; the digestion and metabolism of nutrients; and food intake regulation.

  abstract = {An exciting synergistic interaction occurs among researchers working at the interface of reproductive biology and energy homeostasis. Reproductive biologists benefit from the theories, experimental designs, and methodologies used by experts on energy homeostasis while they bring context and meaning to the study of energy homeostasis. There is a growing recognition that identification of candidate genes for obesity is little more than meaningless reductionism unless those genes and their expression are placed in a developmental, environmental, and evolutionary context. Reproductive biology provides this context because metabolic energy is the most important factor that controls reproductive success and gonadal hormones affect energy intake, storage, and expenditure. Reproductive hormone secretion changes during development, and reproductive success is key to evolutionary adaptation, the process that most likely molded the mechanisms that control energy balance. It is likely that by viewing energy intake, storage, and expenditure in the context of reproductive success, we will gain insight into human obesity, eating disorders, diabetes, and other pathologies related to fuel homeostasis. This review emphasizes the metabolic hypothesis: a sensory system monitors the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels and orchestrates behavioral motivation to optimize reproductive success in environments where energy availability fluctuates or is unpredictable.}

  abstract = { Maintenance of constant body temperature in a homoiothermic animal depends upon a balance between heat production and heat dissipation, and there are consequently three possible main avenues for climatic adaptation, (1) by body-to-air gradient, (2) by heat dissipation, and (3) by metabolic rate. There is no evidence of adaptive low body temperature in arctic mammals and birds, or high body temperature in tropical mammals and birds. The body-to-air gradient can be adapted only by means of behavioral thermoregulation (nest building, avoidance of direct sunshine, etc.). With few exceptions our adult arctic and tropical mammals and birds have a basal metabolic rate that fits the standard mouse to elephant curve, i.e., the basal metabolic rate is determined by an exponential relation to size; evidently fundamental to most animals, warm-blooded or not. The basal metabolic rate is consequently not influenced by such factors as temperature gradient and insulation which largely determine the heat loss, and is hence inadaptive to climate. Equally inadaptive is the body temperature, and the phylogenetic adaptation to cold or hot climate therefore has taken place only through factors that regulate the heat dissipation, notably the fur and skin insulation.For any temperature gradient where the body temperature is maintained, the over-all insulation and the metabolic rate must be so adjusted that their product is proportional to the gradient. This is confirmed by our material inasmuch as the observed critical gradients can be approximately predicted from fur insulation and basal metabolic rate. Under the same climatic conditions there may be an inverse relation between metabolic rate and fur insulation. }

  abstract = { A series of arctic and tropical mammals and birds at Point Barrow, Alaska (lat. 71° N.) and in Panama (lat. 9° N.) was subjected to various air temperatures in a respiration chamber where the heat production was determined by oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production. The larger arctic mammals and birds showed no increase in metabolism at — 30° C. and from observations on sleeping animals it is probable that their zone of thermoneutrality extends to — 40° C. or — 50° C. The smaller arctic species show a high critical temperature and the tropical species even higher. Metabolic heat production increases rapidly with lowering of the temperature in a tropical mammal or bird, and slowly in an arctic animal. It can be shown theoretically that in a thermoregulated system with a fixed basal energy level and variable insulation the critical gradient is proportional to the maximal insulation and the basal energy level.In a large series of experiments including our tropical and arctic animals, and all animals affording enough data in the literature, it is shown that the heat loss below the critical temperature is essentially proportional to the body-to-air gradient. This means that the overall insulation evidently reaches a maximum at the critical temperature and from then on the heat loss follows essentially Newton's law of cooling. It follows from this that an arctic mammal with a critical gradient of 70° C., by doubling its metabolism, theoretically would double the gradient. Only 40 per cent increase of its metabolism (or insulation) would suffice to take it down to — 70° C. which is near the lowest recorded temperature on earth.The very broad zone of thermoneutrality in the larger arctic species, from + 30° C. to — 40° C., shows their ability to balance an 11-fold increase in gradient and hence the animal can change its heat dissipation by a factor of 11 even when lying down. It is believed that vasomotor control of the poorly insulated legs must play an important role in the general thermoregulation of these animals.In the tropical mammals and birds the critical gradient is low, often only 10° C., which makes them sensitive to even small temperature changes. A 10° lowering of the air temperature from the critical temperature doubles the gradient for the tropical mammal; a 9° increase decreases the gradient 10 times, and in order to maintain the body temperature tropical animals must be able to adjust insulation and metabolism in the same proportion as the gradient. They are thus extremely sensitive to temperature changes.The whole range of heat regulation from tropical to arctic mammals and birds is represented on two charts, Figures 10 and 11. }

The ability to switch diet allows the individual to respond to spatial and temporal changes in forage abundance and quality, providing a key mechanism for large herbivores to exploit heterogeneous environments. We compare diet selection and timing of the seasonal dietary switch for a large-bodied, sexually dimorphic mixed-feeder, the African elephant. The study was carried out on a small population of elephants (n  =  48) in the Pongola Game Reserve (PGR), South Africa. Sex-specific dietary composition evaluated from feeding behaviour correlated with composition in dung samples from individuals of known sex. Grass was strongly preferred during the wet season and browse in the winter dry season. However, adult male elephants switched from browse to grass earlier, and consumed a greater overall proportion of grass in their diet, compared with adult females and their associated family groups. Male elephants also spent more time in grassland habitats, and expanded their ranges to a greater extent than females following the end of the dry season. Our results suggest that smaller adult body size, high nutritional demands of offspring, and the constraints of sociality have contributed to female elephants in PGR resolving their diet selection strategies to target higher quality foraging opportunities, whilst males appear to be adopting a rate maximizing approach. The behavioural differences between the sexes are pronounced, which has implications for elephant management approaches that are typically focussed at the population level.}

  abstract     = {The architecture of woody food plants forces mammalian herbivores to make compromises in their food choices. Rapid rates of dry matter intake can be achieved by choosing large bites. For woody plants, however, such bites are low in nutritive quality relative to small bites taken from leaves or twigs near the growing point of the plant. This trade-off between food quality and food intake rate is central to diet optimization in browsing herbivores. We developed a model that predicts a quantitative solution to 'optimal bite size' (i.e., the bite that results in the greatest daily net energy intake) based on constraints in harvesting and digesting foods. This model responds to the chemistry and morphology of plants, and the size and digestive strategy (ruminant versus hindgut fermenter) of the herbivore. We tested the model by conducting a set of experiments in which we offered six species of dormant deciduous trees common to the boreal forests of Sweden to captive roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alces alces). We also tested alternative hypotheses that animals crop bites merely in response to the morphological structure of twigs, or the distribution of twig sizes on trees. Twig diameters cropped by these animals were positively correlated with the diameter at current annual growth. However, structural measures of the trees alone were not sufficient to predict differences in choices of twig diameters among animal species. In contrast, the optimal bite size model accounted for the different bite sizes selected by animals of different sizes and explained 86\% of the variation in twig diameter cropped for all plant and animal species. Hence, we concluded that our model is useful for predicting, a priori, the twig diameters selected by herbivores on dormant deciduous trees. We suggest possible ways to enhance the model and how it can be used to assess forage availability, potential diet quality, and the vulnerability of trees to herbivory.},

A mechanistic model is presented that simulates the functional response, growth and grazing time of ruminants. It is based on results of studies on voluntary food intake and animal production of ruminants. Physiological requirements and food quality are key factors that determine the intake. The model is also based on the results of studies on the functional response of grazers. Quantitative aspects of vegetations i.e. bulk density and height, and the animals’ mouth dimensions are the main factors that determine how much a grazer can swallow. The structure of the model applies to ruminants under tropical conditions. The model parameters are set and validated for the African buffalo, Syncerus caffer. Three variants of the model are elaborated: a non-reproducing female, a reproducing female and a male ruminant. The similarity between the results of the simulation runs and field data are considered to be satisfactory. The results suggest that the quality of the vegetation i.e. the crude protein content, together with the animal's energy requirements, govern the daily intake of food. However, the quantitative characteristics of the vegetation, especially height, can be critical. The model aims to be a tool in the interpretation of empirical field data and in the development of grazing theory. Transparency, concision and a robust empirical basis were therefore striven after in the construction of the model.}

In all, results were obtained for 44 equilibrium periods mostly of 96 weeks duration.For controlled feeding levels, the log-log,. regression of equilibrium body weight on food intake, within animals, was 0·999 (s.e. 0·045). For all results, including mature equilibria, the within-animal regression was 1–014. There was thus no systematic change in an individual's equilibrium maintenance requirement per kg body weight in the range from 25\%, to 100\%, mature. Efficiency of food utilization for equilibrium maintenance was found to be independent of age also, except for a small increase at advanced ages beyond 8 to 9 years.There were significant differences between animals in equilibrium maintenance efficiency, the genetic coefficient of variation being 6·4\%. The most striking result, however, was a within-animal repeatability of 0·7, which meant that almost the same efficiency was re-attained when, after a prolonged period of many years on one constant feeding level, the same animal was allowed to re-establish a new equilibrium on a higher level.Following prolonged periods of food restriction, the animals showed remarkable capacity to recover in body weight even at very advanced ages, but nevertheless substantial stunting of mature weight did occur.},

  abstract = {Recent work suggests that availability and quality of forage in late summer and early autumn, a time when female ungulates face multiple energetic demands, is critical to reproduction in wild ungulates. Therefore, we examined direct links between nutritional quality of diets, body condition, and reproduction of lactating mule deer. Using captive mule deer, we tested the hypothesis that females consuming diets with lower digestible energy (DE; kJ/g) would have lower DE intake rates (DEI; MJ/day), have less body fat and muscle, have later estrus cycles, and have lower pregnancy and twinning rates. Deer fed lower DE diets had lower DEI during summer and autumn. In turn, deer with lower DEI, regardless of diet DE, had lower body mass, body fat, and muscle thickness. When nutritional quality of diets began to decline earlier in the summer, relationships between food quality, DEI, and body condition were stronger. Although DEI did not influence estrus date for deer that became pregnant before 21 December, deer with lower DEI had a lower probability of becoming pregnant and had a lower probability of producing twins. Measures of body condition in October (i.e., body mass, body fat, and muscle depth) predicted pregnancy and twinning rates in mule deer. Serum concentration of hormones leptin and Insulin Growth Factor 1 were not good predictors of body condition or reproduction. These findings suggest that managers concerned with productivity of mule deer populations should consider focusing on assessing and improving quality of forage available in summer and autumn.},

  abstract  = {We measured total body fat (TBF), kidney fat index (KFI), and femur marrow fat (FMF) of 24 adult female and 32 fawn mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) collected in Piceance Basin, Colorado, during winters 1982-83 and 1983-84. All fat stores declined over winter in both age groups. For each age group, ln transformation of left, right, and mean KFI provided higher correlations with TBF than untransformed KFI. Either or both kidneys may be used to calculate KFI during fall through early spring, but data from adult females and fawns should not be combined. Femur marrow fat correlated with ln TBF in both age groups. However, FMF did not predict TBF as well as KFI because the most rapid change in FMF occurred at low percentages of TBF.},

  abstract = {The functional response as the link between the consumer and its resource is a central issue in herbivore–vegetation interactions. Vegetation often consists of low and high quality tissue due to nutritional or structural differences. It has been observed that the instantaneous intake rate of herbivores decreases with decreasing forage quality. However, so far variation in forage quality is not explicitly considered when modeling this instantaneous intake rate. In this paper, we derive a model for the instantaneous intake rate depending on forage quality, i.e., the proportion of high quality tissue in the vegetation. In the model, a downward deflection of the functional response curve is caused by a reduction of the maximum consumption rate at high proportions of low quality tissue. The model gives a mechanistic explanation for decreasing intake rate with decreasing forage quality. Compared to a conventional functional response model with constant maximum consumption rate, a herbivore–grass model with the forage quality-dependent functional response leads to discontinuous changes in the vegetation and herbivore density. The effects hinge on the positive feedback between herbivore density and the proportion of high quality forage. Our analyses show that this positive feedback can explain the maintenance of lawn grass where a high herbivore density can maintain high quality forage. The model results indicate that depending on the coefficients of trophic conversion from resource to consumer, co-existence, facilitation and competitive exclusion between differently sized herbivore species can emerge.}

  abstract = {A complete reproductive cycle of ovulation, conception, pregnancy, and lactation is one of the most energetically expensive activities that a female mammal can undertake. A reproductive attempt at a time when calories are not sufficiently available can result in a reduced return on the maternal energetic investment or even in the death of the mother and her offspring. Numerous physiological and behavioral mechanisms link reproduction and energy metabolism. Reproductive attempts may be interrupted or deferred when food is scarce or when other physiological processes, such as thermoregulation or fattening, make extraordinary energetic demands. Food deprivation suppresses both ovulation and estrous behavior. The neural mechanisms controlling pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and, consequently, luteinizing hormone secretion and ovarian function appear to respond to minute-to-minute changes in the availability of metabolic fuels. It is not clear whether GnRH-secreting neurons are able to detect the availability of metabolic fuels directly or whether this information is relayed from detectors elsewhere in the brain. Although pregnancy is less affected by fuel availability, both lactational performance and maternal behaviors are highly responsive to the energy supply. When a reproductive attempt is made, changes in hormone secretion have dramatic effects on the partitioning and utilization of metabolic fuels. During ovulatory cycles and pregnancy, the ovarian steroids, estradiol and progesterone, induce coordinated changes in the procurement, ingestion, metabolism, storage, and expenditure of metabolic fuels. Estradiol can act in the brain to alter regulatory behaviors, such as food intake and voluntary exercise, as well as adenohypophyseal and autonomic outputs. At the same time, ovarian hormones act on peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, and liver to influence the metabolism, partitioning and storage of metabolic fuels. During lactation, the peptide hormones, prolactin and growth hormone, rather than estradiol and progesterone, are the principal hormones controlling partitioning and utilization of metabolic fuels. The interactions between metabolic fuels and reproduction are reciprocal, redundant, and ubiquitous; both behaviors and physiological processes play vital roles. Although there are species differences in the particular physiological and behavioral mechanisms mediating nutrition-reproduction interactions, two findings are consistent across species: 1) Reproductive physiology and behaviors are sensitive to the availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels. 2) When reproductive attempts are made, ovarian hormones play a major role in the changes in ingestion, partitioning, and utilization of metabolic fuels.}

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores are a major agent in ecosystems, influencing vegetation structure, and carbon and nutrient flows. During the last glacial period, a mammoth steppe ecosystem prevailed in the unglaciated northern lands, supporting a high diversity and density of megafaunal herbivores. The apparent discrepancy between abundant megafauna and the expected low vegetation productivity under a generally harsher climate with a lower CO2 concentration, termed the productivity paradox, requires large-scale quantitative analysis using process-based ecosystem models. However, most of the current global dynamic vegetation models (DGVMs) lack explicit representation of large herbivores. Here we incorporated a grazing module in a DGVM based on physiological and demographic equations for wild large grazers, taking into account feedbacks of large grazers on vegetation. The model was applied globally for present-day and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The present-day results of potential grazer biomass, combined with an empirical land-use map, infer a reduction in wild grazer biomass by 79-93\% owing to anthropogenic land replacement of natural grasslands. For the LGM, we find that the larger mean body size of mammalian herbivores than today is the crucial clue to explain the productivity paradox, due to a more efficient exploitation of grass production by grazers with a large body size.},
