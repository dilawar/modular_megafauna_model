  abstract = {Energy expenditure in animals scales allometrically with body mass, but residual variation is not well understood. We examine the existing data on field metabolic rates (FMR) in endotherms for the potential role of environmental conditions. Across latitude, mass‐corrected FMR of 248 bird and mammal populations fall between two constraint lines: a lower bound that increases towards the poles and is driven by environmental factors and an upper bound that is invariant with latitude and may represent physiological limitations. This triangular pattern can be explained statistically with a multipredictor model that combines environmental conditions and species biology (including phylogeny). Lower environmental temperature and longer day length increase FMR, while taxonomy and diet explain much of the remaining variation. Combined, these effects appear to form a diversity of ‘metabolic niches’ that overall decreases from the tropics to the poles. The potential of factors related to latitude acting as constraints on the ecology and evolution of metabolic strategies in endotherms is discussed.}

  abstract = {Published relationships were used to build a mathematical model that predicts the daily net energy balance of free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries L.) grazing in the U.K. hills. Net energy balance was predicted for a plausible range of environmental conditions. The behaviour of the model suggested the following predictions. Locomotion will be a relatively unimportant energetic cost. Ambient temperature and rainfall alone will rarely affect energy expenditure, whereas wind will greatly increase energetic costs in winter. These are further increased, but to a relatively small extent, by any concurrent rainfall. Predictions of foraging behaviour based on maximisation of energy intake alone are likely to significantly overestimate dry matter intake from climatically exposed vegetation in winter. Where shelter is available, such models will also overestimate total intake in winter by not taking account of sheltering behaviour. This effect will be most pronounced when forage is of low digestibility or availability, wind speeds are high, or the level of coat insulation is low. Foraging models based instead on maximisation of net energy balance are likely to greatly improve predictions of the impact of large herbivores on vegetation and the mechanisms driving their population dynamics.}

  abstract = { The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover. }

  abstract = {As gut capacity is assumed to scale linearly to body mass (BM), and dry matter intake (DMI) to metabolic body weight (BM0.75), it has been proposed that ingesta mean retention time (MRT) should scale to BM0.25 in herbivorous mammals. We test these assumptions with the most comprehensive literature data collations (n = 74 species for gut capacity, n = 93 species for DMI and MRT) to date. For MRT, only data from studies was used during which DMI was also recorded. Gut capacity scaled to BM1.06. In spite of large differences in feeding regimes, absolute DMI (kg/d) scaled to BM0.76 across all species tested. Regardless of this allometry inherent in the dataset, there was only a very low allometric scaling of MRT with BM0.14 across all species. If species were divided according to the morphophysiological design of their digestive tract, there was non-significant scaling of MRT with BM0.04 in colon fermenters, BM0.08 in non-ruminant foregut fermenters, BM0.06 in browsing and BM0.04 in grazing ruminants. In contrast, MRT significantly scaled to BM0.24 (CI 0.16–0.33) in the caecum fermenters. The results suggest that below a certain body size, long MRTs cannot be achieved even though coprophagy is performed; this supports the assumption of a potential body size limitation for herbivory on the lower end of the body size range. However, above a 500 g-threshold, there is no indication of a substantial general increase of MRT with BM. We therefore consider ingesta retention in mammalian herbivores an example of a biological, time-dependent variable that can, on an interspecific level, be dissociated from a supposed obligatory allometric scaling by the morphophysiological design of the digestive tract. We propose that very large body size does not automatically imply a digestive advantage, because long MRTs do not seem to be a characteristic of very large species only. A comparison of the relative DMI (g/kg0.75) with MRT indicates that, on an interspecific level, higher intakes are correlated to shorter MRTs in caecum, colon and non-ruminant foregut fermenters; in contrast, no significant correlation between relative DMI and MRT is evident in ruminants.}

A light wetting water spray simulated heavy fog, mist or light rain, while heavy soaking simulated heavy rain. Wind velocities ranged from 0 to 10 m.s-1. Calf fur samples were from June, August and March. Adult fur samples were females from August and March. There was no evidence for increased heat loss from lightly wet fur relative to dry fur. Calm air conductance decreased for calf fur (P&rsquo;s &lt; 0.05). Adult fur also decreased, however, the difference was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). Further, wind coefficients and regressions for lightly wet fur were similar or below those for dry fur. A thin water film forming on the fur surface may have caused this. It is unlikely that a light rain, fog or mist would cause increased heat loss for Svalbard reindeer, and no increase of metabolic heat production would be needed to maintain thermoregulation. Only the simulated heavy rain dramatically raised heat loss from the fur samples examined regardless of age or season, e.g., heavy soaking increased calm air conductance for all furs (P&rsquo;s &lt; 0.05). This was likely due to the addition of evaporative heat loss from the fur surface and a reduction in the amount of trapped air within the fur. Windchill was of minor importance, since wind coefficients were generally close to zero, meaning increasing wind velocity only marginally raised heat loss even with the added effect of evaporative heat loss. Rain would cause greater insulation loss than increasing wind velocity in Svalbard reindeer of all ages, with the exception of calves under one month old, which could experience dramatic insulation loss from a combination of heavy rain and windchill. Dry or wet, Svalbard reindeer fur appears to provide better insulation than fur of others of their species.},

  abstract = {Development of nutritional energetics can be traced to the 1400s. Lavoisier established relationships among O2 use, CO2 production and heat production in the late 1700s, and the laws of thermodynamics and law of Hess were discovered during the 1840s. Those discoveries established the fundamental bases for nutritional energetics and enabled the fundamental entity ME = retained energy + heat energy to be established. Objectives became: 1) to establish relationships between gas exchange and heat energy, 2) to devise bases for evaluation of foods that could be related to energy expenditures, and 3) to establish causes of energy expenditures. From these endeavors, the basic concepts of energy partitioning by animals were developed, ultimately resulting in the development of feeding systems based on NE concepts. The California Net Energy System, developed for finishing beef cattle, was the first to be based on retained energy as determined by comparative slaughter and the first to use 2 NE values (NEm and NEg) to describe feed and animal requirements. The system has been broadened conceptually to encompass life cycle energy requirements of beef cattle and modified by the inclusion of numerous adjustments to address factors known to affect energy requirements and value of feed to meet those needs. The current NE system remains useful but is empirical and static in nature and thus fails to capture the dynamics of energy utilization by diverse animals as they respond to changing environmental conditions. Consequently, efforts were initiated to develop dynamic simulation models that captured the underlying biology and thus were sensitive to variable genetic and environmental conditions. Development of a series of models has been described to show examples of the conceptual evolution of dynamic, mechanistic models and their applications. Generally with each new system, advances in prediction accuracy came about by adding new terms to conceptually validated models. However, complexity of input requirements often limits general use of these larger models. Expert systems may be utilized to provide many of the additional inputs needed for application of the more complex models. Additional information available from these systems is expected to result in an everincreasing range of application. These systems are expected to have increased generality and the capability to be integrated with other models to allow economic evaluation. This will eventually allow users to compute solutions that allow development of optimal production strategies.},

  abstract  = {How different kinds of organisms adapt to environmental temperature is central to understanding how they respond to past, present, and future climate change. We applied the Scholander{\textendash}Irving model of thermoregulation to data on hundreds of species of birds and mammals to assess the contributions of three avenues of adaptation to environmental temperature: body size, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and thermal conductance. Adaptation via body size is limited; the entire ranges of body sizes of birds and mammals occur in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we demonstrate that birds and mammals have adapted to geographic variation in environmental temperature regimes by concerted changes in both BMR and thermal conductance.The extent to which different kinds of organisms have adapted to environmental temperature regimes is central to understanding how they respond to climate change. The Scholander{\textendash}Irving (S-I) model of heat transfer lays the foundation for explaining how endothermic birds and mammals maintain their high, relatively constant body temperatures in the face of wide variation in environmental temperature. The S-I model shows how body temperature is regulated by balancing the rates of heat production and heat loss. Both rates scale with body size, suggesting that larger animals should be better adapted to cold environments than smaller animals, and vice versa. However, the global distributions of \~{}9,000 species of terrestrial birds and mammals show that the entire range of body sizes occurs in nearly all climatic regimes. Using physiological and environmental temperature data for 211 bird and 178 mammal species, we test for mass-independent adaptive changes in two key parameters of the S-I model: basal metabolic rate (BMR) and thermal conductance. We derive an axis of thermal adaptation that is independent of body size, extends the S-I model, and highlights interactions among physiological and morphological traits that allow endotherms to persist in a wide range of temperatures. Our macrophysiological and macroecological analyses support our predictions that shifts in BMR and thermal conductance confer important adaptations to environmental temperature in both birds and mammals.},

Thus Huxley calculated that the progeny of a single Aphis in the course of 10 generations, supposing all survived,would “contain more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of China”, (in Thompson, 1929). Checks, however, do occur and it has been the subject of much controversy to determine how these checks operate. Certain general principles—the density-dependence concept of Smith ( 1955) , the competition theory of Nicholson (1933)—have been proposed both verbally and mathematically, but because they have been based in part upon untested and restrictive assumptions they have been severelv criticized (e.g. Andrewartha and Birch 1954). These problems could be considerably clarified if we knew the mode of operation of each process that affects numbers, if we knew its basic and subsidiary components. predation, one such process, forms the subject of the present paper.},

  abstract = {Behind the nutritional labelling of food fat hides a problem of definition of fat, as well as an analytical problem. Although triacylglycerols are the prevailing structure of the food lipids in most cases, there are exceptions, too. Analytes called ether extract, crude fat, total fat and total lipids have been interpreted to food fat in nutritional labelling and food databases. However, the techniques traditionally used for fat determination in foods may vary considerably in their ability to recover the various lipid components. Diversity in the lipid composition of various foods and the effects of processing and storage on the diversity and availability of the fat make the correct nutritional labelling of fat problematic. The traditional methods, where the total fat content is determined by extracting the fat with an appropriate fat solvent or a solvent mixture, give good technical measures. The use of this extracted fat-soluble material as the nutritional concept of fat may be misleading. We have suggested (Hyvönen et al., 1993, J. Food Comp. Anal., 6, 24–40) the use of the concept of net fat in nutritional food labelling. This definition of fat includes all the unchanged fatty acids from the various food lipids converted to triacylglycerols. In energy calculations 1 g of net fat corresponds to 9 kcal or 38 kJ. This concept reduces the energy values of foods because it eliminates the lipid components, which are not real fats, from the calculation.}

  abstract = {Summary A simulation model is used to quantify relationships between diet quality, digestive processes and body weight in ungulate herbivores. Retention time of food in the digestive tract is shown by regression to scale with W0.27, and to be longer in ruminants than in hindgut fermenters. Allometric relationships between whole gut mean retention time ({MRT}, h) and weight (W) were: {MRT} = 9.4 W0.255 (r 2 = 0.80) for hindgut fermenters and {MRT} = 15.3 W0.251 (r 2 = 0.76) in ruminants. Longer retention of ingesta by large-bodied ruminants and hindgut fermenters increases digestive efficiency relative to small animals and permits them to survive on lower-quality foods. Compared with ruminants, hindgut fermenters' faster throughput is an advantage which outweighs their lower digestive efficiency, particularly on poor quality foods, provided that food resources are not limiting. This suggests that the predominance of ruminants in the middle range of body weights results from their more efficient use of scarce resources under conditions of resource depletion. Considering only physical limitations on intake, the model shows that the allometric coefficient which scales energy intake to body mass is 0.88 in ruminants and 0.82 in hindgut fermenters. The advantages of large body size are countered by disadvantages where food quantity is limited, and we suggest that the upper limit to ungulate body size is determined by the ability to extract nutrients from feeding niches during the nadir of the seasonal cycle of resource quality and abundance.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that climatic variation has the effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid grazing systems of reducing animal numbers below the level at which they have much impact on vegetation or soils, and that spatial heterogeneity in resource availability serves to buffer herbivores against climatic variation. Modelling was used to test these hypotheses and to examine the interacting effects of temporal and spatial variability in plant production on animal population dynamics and defoliation intensity. The model distinguishes areas of the range that are accessible during wet and dry seasons, and examines the effect of seasonal restrictions in foraging area. It was established that the animal population is in long-term equilibrium with dry-season resources, on which it depends for survival; that dry season resource areas and outlying areas thus operate in a source-sink manner; and that the ratio of these areas determines the strength of consumer-resource coupling outside the dry-season range. A high ratio of dry season to wet season resources may support a sufficiently large animal population to impose non-trivial defoliation impacts on the outlying range. Increasing degrees of variability in primary production on areas used by animals for surviving the dry season increased the annual variation in animal abundance and reduced the mean. By comparison with a stable environment, for which the model predicts virtually stable animal numbers and constant, low defoliation intensity, variation in annual rainfall causes wide fluctuations in animal numbers and defoliation intensity. Under climatic variation, animal numbers can build up enough to impose much higher defoliation intensities than under a constant regime. Periodic intense defoliation is a consequence of climatic variability which is likely to make these environments more, not less, prone to ecological change.},

A GMM (Growth, Metabolism and Mortality) formulation was applied to the interactive dynamics of herbivore–vegetation systems, taking into account seasonality in resource production, heterogeneity in resource quality, adaptive responses by consumers to this variability, and nutritional influences on mortality losses. In transforming the intake or functional response to changing resource availability to a biomass gain response, allowance was made for constraints on daily digestive capacity, and for changing diet quality as resources became depleted over the seasonal cycle. Because of the steeply saturating form of the intake response, the output dynamics was inherently unstable in a constant environment with a single, uniform resource, for realistic parameter values. Stabilization resulted when resources were heterogeneous and herbivores adjusted their resource selection adaptively over the course of the year. This mechanism caused the gain response to diverge from the intake response, due to changing diet quality over the annual cycle. In seasonally varying environments, no equilibrium between resource production and consumption persists. Nevertheless, dynamic stability can emerge from the adaptive responses of consumers to spatial and temporal variability in resource availability and quality.}

  abstract = { Large grazers have played a fundamental role in grassland and savannah ecosystems since these vegetation types formed in the late Miocene, but the feedback loops between vegetation and large grazers are still not well understood. Modern dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lack the explicit impact of herbivory, but are calibrated to benchmarks including herbivory. We coupled a generalized model for the population dynamics of large mammalian grazers, based on animal physiology, with a plant-physiological model for vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes, applicable at local to global scales (LPJ-GUESS). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine process-based grazer population and vegetation modelling in a single generalized modelling framework, applicable at regional to continental scales. The capability of the coupled model to reproduce real-world grazer densities was tested by comparing modelled biomass densities with empirical data from African game parks, where semi-natural grazer populations still exist. The model reproduced inter-park differences in long-term average grazer biomass densities and yielded similar dependencies between major environmental drivers (e.g. precipitation, annual net primary productivity (NPP), dry season length) and grazer population densities as found in other more empirical studies. Amongst the potential environmental drivers, modelled NPP and dry season length were most strongly correlated with empirical and modelled biomass densities. Major discrepancies between modelled and empirical densities occurred for individual parks, but this was expected because the model did not include all factors that influence grazer populations (e.g. nutrient dynamics and poaching). The generalized flexible framework of the coupled model makes it possible to apply the model to other regions, to include further processes (if data for parameterizing them is available) and to parameterize other types of grazers. It could become a useful tool for investigating interactions between grazers and vegetation in a process-based framework.}

We calculated the energy-intake component from seasonal dry matter and energy content, dry matter digestibility, and a metabolizable energy coefficient for each plant species ingested. We estimated energy expenditures when foraging as the sum of energy costs of standing, horizontal and vertical locomotion, sinking depths in snow, and supplementary expenditures associated with temperatures outside thermoneutrality. Energy intake per minute averaged 4.0 times more in summer than winter; energy expenditure was 1.2 times greater in summer. Animals obtained higher amounts of metabolizable energy with higher amounts of energy invested. Energy intake during foraging bouts in summer was 2.5 times the energy invested; in contrast, energy intake during winter was only 0.7 times the energy expended. Changes in body mass of deer throughout the year increased asymptotically with foraging efficiency, driven primarily by the rate of metabolizable energy intake. Within a season, summer intake rates and winter rates of energy expediture had the greatest effects on the relation between foraging efficiency and mass status. Seasonal changes in foraging efficiency result in seasonal cycles in body mass and condition in black-tailed deer. Body reserves accumulated during summer, however, are essential for over-winter survival of north-temperate ungulates because energy demands cannot be met by foraging alone. }

A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.}

The book discusses the five major nutritional categories of constituents that animals must acquire from their external environments: energy, protein, water, minerals, and vitamins. Subsequent chapters cover topics such as the estimation of energy and protein requirements; dietary protein requirements for captive wildlife and free-ranging populations; wildlife reproductive characteristics; the digestion and metabolism of nutrients; and food intake regulation.

There is no evidence of adaptive low body temperature in arctic mammals and birds, or high body temperature in tropical mammals and birds. The body-to-air gradient can be adapted only by means of behavioral thermoregulation (nest building, avoidance of direct sunshine, etc.). With few exceptions our adult arctic and tropical mammals and birds have a basal metabolic rate that fits the standard mouse to elephant curve, i.e., the basal metabolic rate is determined by an exponential relation to size; evidently fundamental to most animals, warm-blooded or not. The basal metabolic rate is consequently not influenced by such factors as temperature gradient and insulation which largely determine the heat loss, and is hence inadaptive to climate. Equally inadaptive is the body temperature, and the phylogenetic adaptation to cold or hot climate therefore has taken place only through factors that regulate the heat dissipation, notably the fur and skin insulation.For any temperature gradient where the body temperature is maintained, the over-all insulation and the metabolic rate must be so adjusted that their product is proportional to the gradient. This is confirmed by our material inasmuch as the observed critical gradients can be approximately predicted from fur insulation and basal metabolic rate. Under the same climatic conditions there may be an inverse relation between metabolic rate and fur insulation. }

  abstract = { A series of arctic and tropical mammals and birds at Point Barrow, Alaska (lat. 71° N.) and in Panama (lat. 9° N.) was subjected to various air temperatures in a respiration chamber where the heat production was determined by oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production. The larger arctic mammals and birds showed no increase in metabolism at — 30° C. and from observations on sleeping animals it is probable that their zone of thermoneutrality extends to — 40° C. or — 50° C. The smaller arctic species show a high critical temperature and the tropical species even higher. Metabolic heat production increases rapidly with lowering of the temperature in a tropical mammal or bird, and slowly in an arctic animal. It can be shown theoretically that in a thermoregulated system with a fixed basal energy level and variable insulation the critical gradient is proportional to the maximal insulation and the basal energy level.In a large series of experiments including our tropical and arctic animals, and all animals affording enough data in the literature, it is shown that the heat loss below the critical temperature is essentially proportional to the body-to-air gradient. This means that the overall insulation evidently reaches a maximum at the critical temperature and from then on the heat loss follows essentially Newton's law of cooling. It follows from this that an arctic mammal with a critical gradient of 70° C., by doubling its metabolism, theoretically would double the gradient. Only 40 per cent increase of its metabolism (or insulation) would suffice to take it down to — 70° C. which is near the lowest recorded temperature on earth.The very broad zone of thermoneutrality in the larger arctic species, from + 30° C. to — 40° C., shows their ability to balance an 11-fold increase in gradient and hence the animal can change its heat dissipation by a factor of 11 even when lying down. It is believed that vasomotor control of the poorly insulated legs must play an important role in the general thermoregulation of these animals.In the tropical mammals and birds the critical gradient is low, often only 10° C., which makes them sensitive to even small temperature changes. A 10° lowering of the air temperature from the critical temperature doubles the gradient for the tropical mammal; a 9° increase decreases the gradient 10 times, and in order to maintain the body temperature tropical animals must be able to adjust insulation and metabolism in the same proportion as the gradient. They are thus extremely sensitive to temperature changes.The whole range of heat regulation from tropical to arctic mammals and birds is represented on two charts, Figures 10 and 11. }

The ability to switch diet allows the individual to respond to spatial and temporal changes in forage abundance and quality, providing a key mechanism for large herbivores to exploit heterogeneous environments. We compare diet selection and timing of the seasonal dietary switch for a large-bodied, sexually dimorphic mixed-feeder, the African elephant. The study was carried out on a small population of elephants (n  =  48) in the Pongola Game Reserve (PGR), South Africa. Sex-specific dietary composition evaluated from feeding behaviour correlated with composition in dung samples from individuals of known sex. Grass was strongly preferred during the wet season and browse in the winter dry season. However, adult male elephants switched from browse to grass earlier, and consumed a greater overall proportion of grass in their diet, compared with adult females and their associated family groups. Male elephants also spent more time in grassland habitats, and expanded their ranges to a greater extent than females following the end of the dry season. Our results suggest that smaller adult body size, high nutritional demands of offspring, and the constraints of sociality have contributed to female elephants in PGR resolving their diet selection strategies to target higher quality foraging opportunities, whilst males appear to be adopting a rate maximizing approach. The behavioural differences between the sexes are pronounced, which has implications for elephant management approaches that are typically focussed at the population level.}

  abstract     = {The architecture of woody food plants forces mammalian herbivores to make compromises in their food choices. Rapid rates of dry matter intake can be achieved by choosing large bites. For woody plants, however, such bites are low in nutritive quality relative to small bites taken from leaves or twigs near the growing point of the plant. This trade-off between food quality and food intake rate is central to diet optimization in browsing herbivores. We developed a model that predicts a quantitative solution to 'optimal bite size' (i.e., the bite that results in the greatest daily net energy intake) based on constraints in harvesting and digesting foods. This model responds to the chemistry and morphology of plants, and the size and digestive strategy (ruminant versus hindgut fermenter) of the herbivore. We tested the model by conducting a set of experiments in which we offered six species of dormant deciduous trees common to the boreal forests of Sweden to captive roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and moose (Alces alces). We also tested alternative hypotheses that animals crop bites merely in response to the morphological structure of twigs, or the distribution of twig sizes on trees. Twig diameters cropped by these animals were positively correlated with the diameter at current annual growth. However, structural measures of the trees alone were not sufficient to predict differences in choices of twig diameters among animal species. In contrast, the optimal bite size model accounted for the different bite sizes selected by animals of different sizes and explained 86\% of the variation in twig diameter cropped for all plant and animal species. Hence, we concluded that our model is useful for predicting, a priori, the twig diameters selected by herbivores on dormant deciduous trees. We suggest possible ways to enhance the model and how it can be used to assess forage availability, potential diet quality, and the vulnerability of trees to herbivory.},

  abstract = {A dynamic model of the functional response is a first prerequisite to be able to bridge the gap between local feeding ecology and grazing rules that pertain to larger scales. A mechanistic model is presented that simulates the functional response, growth and grazing time of ruminants. It is based on results of studies on voluntary food intake and animal production of ruminants. Physiological requirements and food quality are key factors that determine the intake. The model is also based on the results of studies on the functional response of grazers. Quantitative aspects of vegetations i.e. bulk density and height, and the animals’ mouth dimensions are the main factors that determine how much a grazer can swallow. The structure of the model applies to ruminants under tropical conditions. The model parameters are set and validated for the African buffalo, Syncerus caffer. Three variants of the model are elaborated: a non-reproducing female, a reproducing female and a male ruminant. The similarity between the results of the simulation runs and field data are considered to be satisfactory. The results suggest that the quality of the vegetation i.e. the crude protein content, together with the animal's energy requirements, govern the daily intake of food. However, the quantitative characteristics of the vegetation, especially height, can be critical. The model aims to be a tool in the interpretation of empirical field data and in the development of grazing theory. Transparency, concision and a robust empirical basis were therefore striven after in the construction of the model.}

Newborn calves maintained a high rectal temperature (Tre) (+39 to +41&deg;C) even at &mdash;23&deg;C by increasing heat production 5- to 6-fold through non-shivering thermogenesis, stimulated by cold-induced noradrenaline (NA). Plasma NA and thyroxine (T4) were high (18 ng/ml and 459 nmol/1) in neonatal reindeer. Sensitivity to exogenous NA was lost during the first 3-4 weeks of life. At +20&deg;C and above, calves increased Tre (ca 1&deg;C), oxygen consumption and heart rate, thereby showing poor heat tolerance. Thermal conductance was low in a cold environment, but rose sharply as ambient temperature (Ta) increased above + 10&deg;C. The Tre of adults (+ 38 to +39&deg;C) was independent of Ta (&mdash;28 to +15&deg;C). Coarse (hollow) hair density and length in adults averaged 2000/cm2 and 12 mm on the legs, 1000/cm3 and 30 mm on the abdomen and 1700/cm2 and 30 mm on the back (calves 3200/cm2, 10 mm), respectively. The dependence of skin temperature on the Ta was linear in excised fur samples, but complex in living animals being strongest in the legs. Serum adrenaline correlated with the weight, age and total lipids. Serum NA and dopamine-fi-hydroxylase were highest in spring and decreased by autumn. Serum T4 was highest in summer and lowest in spring.},

  abstract = {Twenty-two unmated female Ayrshire twin cattle, that had initially been maintained for prolonged periods on one of six constant feeding levels until an equilibrium weight was attained, were subsequently moved up to higher constant feeding levels including ad libitum. In all, results were obtained for 44 equilibrium periods mostly of 96 weeks duration.For controlled feeding levels, the log-log,. regression of equilibrium body weight on food intake, within animals, was 0·999 (s.e. 0·045). For all results, including mature equilibria, the within-animal regression was 1–014. There was thus no systematic change in an individual's equilibrium maintenance requirement per kg body weight in the range from 25\%, to 100\%, mature. Efficiency of food utilization for equilibrium maintenance was found to be independent of age also, except for a small increase at advanced ages beyond 8 to 9 years.There were significant differences between animals in equilibrium maintenance efficiency, the genetic coefficient of variation being 6·4\%. The most striking result, however, was a within-animal repeatability of 0·7, which meant that almost the same efficiency was re-attained when, after a prolonged period of many years on one constant feeding level, the same animal was allowed to re-establish a new equilibrium on a higher level.Following prolonged periods of food restriction, the animals showed remarkable capacity to recover in body weight even at very advanced ages, but nevertheless substantial stunting of mature weight did occur.},

  abstract = {The functional response as the link between the consumer and its resource is a central issue in herbivore–vegetation interactions. Vegetation often consists of low and high quality tissue due to nutritional or structural differences. It has been observed that the instantaneous intake rate of herbivores decreases with decreasing forage quality. However, so far variation in forage quality is not explicitly considered when modeling this instantaneous intake rate. In this paper, we derive a model for the instantaneous intake rate depending on forage quality, i.e., the proportion of high quality tissue in the vegetation. In the model, a downward deflection of the functional response curve is caused by a reduction of the maximum consumption rate at high proportions of low quality tissue. The model gives a mechanistic explanation for decreasing intake rate with decreasing forage quality. Compared to a conventional functional response model with constant maximum consumption rate, a herbivore–grass model with the forage quality-dependent functional response leads to discontinuous changes in the vegetation and herbivore density. The effects hinge on the positive feedback between herbivore density and the proportion of high quality forage. Our analyses show that this positive feedback can explain the maintenance of lawn grass where a high herbivore density can maintain high quality forage. The model results indicate that depending on the coefficients of trophic conversion from resource to consumer, co-existence, facilitation and competitive exclusion between differently sized herbivore species can emerge.}

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {Large herbivores are a major agent in ecosystems, influencing vegetation structure, and carbon and nutrient flows. During the last glacial period, a mammoth steppe ecosystem prevailed in the unglaciated northern lands, supporting a high diversity and density of megafaunal herbivores. The apparent discrepancy between abundant megafauna and the expected low vegetation productivity under a generally harsher climate with a lower CO2 concentration, termed the productivity paradox, requires large-scale quantitative analysis using process-based ecosystem models. However, most of the current global dynamic vegetation models (DGVMs) lack explicit representation of large herbivores. Here we incorporated a grazing module in a DGVM based on physiological and demographic equations for wild large grazers, taking into account feedbacks of large grazers on vegetation. The model was applied globally for present-day and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The present-day results of potential grazer biomass, combined with an empirical land-use map, infer a reduction in wild grazer biomass by 79-93\% owing to anthropogenic land replacement of natural grasslands. For the LGM, we find that the larger mean body size of mammalian herbivores than today is the crucial clue to explain the productivity paradox, due to a more efficient exploitation of grass production by grazers with a large body size.},
