# Results from the Megafauna Demo Simulator

Each aggregation unit (habitat group) comprises several habitats.
Since all habitats have the same properties and there is no stochasticity, the curves from all aggregation units look the same.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
filename <- "mass_density_per_hft.tsv"
if (!is.file(filename))
  stop("File does not exist: ", filename)
mass.tbl <- gather(read.csv(filename, sep = "\t"),
  key = HFT, value = mass, -Year, -agg_unit)
mass.tbl$mass <- mass.tbl$mass / 100  # kg/kmÂ²->kg/ha
ggplot(mass.tbl, aes(x = Year, y = mass, color = HFT)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~agg_unit) +
  labs(
    x = "Simulation Year",
    y = "Mean Mass Density [kg/ha]",
    title = "Mass Density per Habitat Group"
  )
```
